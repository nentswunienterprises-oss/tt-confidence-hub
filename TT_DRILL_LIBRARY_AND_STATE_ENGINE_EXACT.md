# TT Drill Library And State Engine Exact Reference

Derived from:

- `client/src/components/tutor/IntroSessionDrillRunner.tsx`
- `shared/topicConditioningEngine.ts`
- `client/src/components/tutor/topicConditioningEngine.ts`
- `client/src/components/parent/ProposalView.tsx`
- `shared/observationScoring.ts`

## Core runtime rules

- `phase`: `Clarity`, `Structured Execution`, `Controlled Discomfort`, `Time Pressure Stability`
- `stability`: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `High Maintenance`
- `session` mode uses the training drill library for each selected topic.
- `diagnosis` mode uses `DIAGNOSIS_SETS_BY_PHASE`.
- `training` mode uses `TRAINING_SETS_BY_PHASE`.
- Observation scoring is positional:
  - first option => `weak`
  - middle option => `partial`
  - last option => `clear`
- `getObservationBlockForRep`:
  - uses rep-specific `repObservationBlocks` when present
  - otherwise reuses the same `observationBlock` for every rep

## Phase context shown in runner

### Clarity

- Purpose: `Can the student see the problem clearly before solving? Clarity = naming what's there, recognizing the method, understanding why. If this fails - everything else collapses.`
- Constraints:
  - `No Boss Battles`
  - `No time pressure`
  - `No skipping layers`

### Structured Execution

- Purpose: `Test and build ability to execute the known method independently. Student knows - now prove they can do it alone, repeatably.`
- Constraints:
  - `State steps before solving`
  - `No guessing tolerated`
  - `No skipping steps`

### Controlled Discomfort

- Purpose: `Test and stabilize behavior under uncertainty and difficulty. Does the student persist - or shut down?`
- Constraints:
  - `No full rescue`
  - `Hold discomfort window`
  - `One-step confirmation max`

### Time Pressure Stability

- Purpose: `Maintain method structure under urgency. Structure is the target - speed is secondary.`
- Constraints:
  - `Method over speed`
  - `Timer is active`
  - `Structured response required - no panic tolerance`

## State engine exact overview

## 1. Transition engine

Source: `shared/topicConditioningEngine.ts`

Inputs:

- `previous_phase`
- `previous_stability`
- `drill_total_out_of_100`

Outputs:

- `next_phase`
- `next_stability`
- `transition_reason`

Thresholds:

- From `Low`:
  - `0-49` => remain `Low`
  - `50-79` => advance to `Medium`
  - `80-100` => advance to `High`
- From `Medium`:
  - `0-44` => regress to `Low`
  - `45-79` => remain `Medium`
  - `80-100` => advance to `High`
- From `High`:
  - `0-49` => regress to `Medium`
  - `50-84` => remain `High`
  - `85-100` => advance to `High Maintenance`
- From `High Maintenance`:
  - `0-59` => regress to `High`
  - `60-84` => remain `High Maintenance`
  - `85-100` => `phase progress`, move to next phase at `Low`

Phase progression rule:

- Only legal when previous stability is `High Maintenance` and score is `>= 85`
- `next_phase = getNextPhase(previous_phase)`
- `next_stability = Low`
- If already in final phase, `getNextPhase` returns current phase, so final-phase `High Maintenance` + `85+` produces the same phase at `Low` with `phase progress`

## 2. Next-action engine

Source: `shared/topicConditioningEngine.ts` and `client/src/components/tutor/topicConditioningEngine.ts`

Per phase × stability, the engine provides:

- `primaryAction`
- `rules`
- `nextActions`
- optional `advanceTo`

## 3. Tutor-facing interpreted state

Source: `client/src/components/tutor/topicConditioningEngine.ts`

`interpretTopicState` returns:

- `nextAction`: the `primaryAction`
- `transitionStatus`:
  - `High Maintenance`:
    - non-final phase => `Advance to <next phase>`
    - final phase => `Maintain and transfer to new topics`
  - `High` => `Run High Maintenance check before advancing`
  - `Medium` => `Hold current phase - build stability before advancing`
  - `Low`:
    - `Clarity` => `Hold at Clarity - reinforce foundations`
    - otherwise => `Reinforce <previous phase> - stability too low to advance`

## 4. Observation-behavior translation

Source: `shared/topicConditioningEngine.ts`

`mapObservationsToBehavior` maps normalized observation levels into phrases by key family:

- Clarity family
  - Aliases: `vocabulary`, `reason`, `immediate_apply`, `immediateapply`
  - Weak => `clarity breakdown`
  - Clear => `clearer concept recall`
- Method family
  - Aliases: `method`, `step`, `execution`, `repeatability`
  - Weak => `inconsistent step execution`
  - Clear => `more reliable step execution`
- Independence family
  - Aliases: `independence`, `dependence`, `support`, `rescue`
  - Weak => `early dependence`
  - Clear => `more independent execution`
- Start family
  - Aliases: `start`, `initial`
  - Weak => `delayed starts`
  - Clear => `earlier independent starts`
- Difficulty family
  - Aliases: `boss`, `discomfort`, `pressure`, `first_step`
  - Weak => `hesitation under pressure`
  - Clear => `better control under difficulty`
- Structure family
  - Aliases: `structure`, `completion`, `integrity`
  - Weak => `structure breakdown`
  - Clear => `stronger structure retention`
- Pace family
  - Aliases: `pace`, `time`, `speed`
  - Weak => `pace loss`
  - Clear => `more controlled pace`
- Fallback: `no mapped observation signal detected`

## 5. Parent translation engine

Actual parent meaning source for dashboard state copy:

- `client/src/pages/client/parent/dashboard.tsx`
- constant name in current code: `PARENT_STATE_ENGINE`

This is the phase-specific parent dashboard matrix to use for `status`, `meaning`, and `focus`.

### Clarity

- Low:
  - Status: `Your child is still building a clear understanding of this topic.`
  - Meaning: `They are not yet fully comfortable with the terms, steps, or logic involved.`
  - Focus: `We are rebuilding the foundation so they can clearly recognize and understand the problem.`
- Medium:
  - Status: `Your child is beginning to understand this topic more clearly.`
  - Meaning: `They can follow explanations, but still need reinforcement to apply it independently.`
  - Focus: `We are increasing practice and helping them apply the method more consistently.`
- High:
  - Status: `Your child now understands this topic clearly.`
  - Meaning: `They can recognize the problem and explain the steps with confidence.`
  - Focus: `We are moving into independent problem-solving to build execution.`
- High Maintenance:
  - Status: `Your child has sustained strong clarity in this topic.`

  - Status: `Your child is learning to stay structured under time pressure.`
  - Meaning: `They can solve problems, but may lose structure when working against the clock.`

  - Meaning: `They consistently maintain structure and accuracy under timed conditions.`
  - Focus: `We are maintaining performance and expanding transfer across related topics.`

Generic shared translator still exists in `shared/topicConditioningEngine.ts`, but it is not the actual dashboard phase-specific meaning source.

`translateTransitionForParent` maps:

- `stability advance` => `showing improved consistency`
- `stability regress` => `working through some challenges`
- `phase progress` => `ready to advance to the next level`
- `remain` => `continuing to build at this level`
- default => `making steady progress`

## 6. Proposal-view parent state matrix
