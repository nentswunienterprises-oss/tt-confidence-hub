            Start with the session context. Intro is used when a student is entering TT in a topic

          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Start with the session context. Handover is used when one tutor is replacing another
            and the student has already been actively trained in TT before.
          </p>

            Handover uses the same phase structure, but in a shorter check format.
            Its job is to confirm where training should continue from, not to place the student from
            scratch and not to jump straight back into normal training.
