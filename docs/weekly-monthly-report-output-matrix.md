# Weekly and Monthly Reports: Full Engine and Output Breakdown

This document describes how TT weekly and monthly reports are currently built, which engines contribute to them, where each output line comes from, and what the possible scenario outputs are.

Primary code paths:

- Report generation: `server/routes.ts`
- Parent report mapping: `server/routes.ts` `mapParentFacingReport`
- Parent display: `client/src/pages/client/parent/progress.tsx`
- Tutor display: `client/src/components/tutor/StudentReportsDialog.tsx`
- Shared phase/stability/meaning/action engines: `shared/topicConditioningEngine.ts`

## End-to-end flow

1. A tutor submits diagnosis or training drill data.
2. The drill row is stored in `intro_session_drills`.
3. `maybeAutoSendDeterministicReports(studentId, tutorId)` runs after drill submission.
4. The system fetches all drill rows for the student and tutor.
5. Each drill row is normalized by `mapDrillRowToDeterministicSession`.
6. Handover verification drills are ignored for weekly/monthly reports.
7. Drill rows are grouped into session groups by `sessionGroupId`.
8. Weekly windows are created from every `2` completed session groups.
9. Monthly windows are created from every `8` completed session groups.
10. Each report window becomes structured JSON.
11. Structured JSON is inserted into `parent_reports.summary`.
12. Legacy columns are also populated for compatibility.
13. Parent reports are fetched through `/api/parent/reports`.
14. `mapParentFacingReport` converts stored report rows into parent UI fields.
15. Parent UI renders weekly and monthly cards.

## Trigger rules

### Weekly

Weekly reports are generated from pairs of completed session groups.

Window rule:

- Session groups are sorted by earliest date.
- The system creates windows using indexes `[0,1]`, `[2,3]`, `[4,5]`, etc.
- A leftover single session does not generate a weekly report yet.

Generated after:

- `2` completed session groups.

### Monthly

Monthly reports are generated from sets of eight completed session groups.

Window rule:

- Session groups are sorted by earliest date.
- The system creates windows using indexes `[0..7]`, `[8..15]`, etc.
- Fewer than eight pending session groups do not generate a monthly report yet.

Generated after:

- `8` completed session groups.

## Source drill normalization

Each drill row becomes a deterministic session with these report-relevant fields:

- `id`
- `date`
- `sessionGroupId`
- `topic`
- `drillType`
- `behaviorPatterns`
- `score`
- `phaseBefore`
- `phaseAfter`
- `stabilityBefore`
- `stabilityAfter`
- `nextAction`
- `transitionReason`
- `deterministicLog`

### Diagnosis drill normalization

Diagnosis rows use:

- topic from `introTopic` or `trainingTopic`
- phase from `phase` or `summary.phase`
- stability from `summary.stability`
- diagnosis score from `summary.diagnosisScore`
- transition reason is always `remain`
- phase after is the diagnosis/training entry phase
- next action comes from `summary.nextAction` or `NEXT_ACTION_ENGINE`

Diagnosis reports can still contribute to weekly/monthly windows because diagnosis rows become deterministic sessions.

### Training drill normalization

Training rows use:

- topic from `trainingTopic` or `introTopic`
- phase before from submitted/current phase
- phase after from `summary.phase`
- previous stability from `summary.previousStability`
- stability after from `summary.stability`
- transition reason from `summary.transitionReason` or `summary.transition_reason`
- if missing, `phaseDecision` can infer:
- `advance` -> `phase progress`
- `regress` -> `stability regress`
- anything else -> `remain`

### Handover verification rows

Handover verification rows return `null` from report normalization.

Result:

- They do not contribute to weekly/monthly parent reports.

## Phase engine

Valid phases:

- `Clarity`
- `Structured Execution`
- `Controlled Discomfort`
- `Time Pressure Stability`

Phase purposes used in monthly `Next Month Focus`:

- `Clarity`: `recognizing terms, steps, and reasoning`
- `Structured Execution`: `following steps independently`
- `Controlled Discomfort`: `staying stable under difficulty`
- `Time Pressure Stability`: `maintaining structure under time`

## Stability engine

Valid stability states:

- `Low`
- `Medium`
- `High`
- `High Maintenance`

Stability scores used for ranking/report comparison:

- `Low` -> `1`
- `Medium` -> `2`
- `High` -> `3`
- `High Maintenance` -> `4`

Report scoring rank:

- phase rank is multiplied by `10`
- stability rank is added
- this lets the report engine detect whether a topic moved forward between first and last drill state

Phase rank:

- `Clarity` -> `0`
- `Structured Execution` -> `1`
- `Controlled Discomfort` -> `2`
- `Time Pressure Stability` -> `3`

Example:

- `Structured Execution (Medium)` -> `1 * 10 + 1 = 11`
- `Structured Execution (High)` -> `1 * 10 + 2 = 12`
- `Controlled Discomfort (Low)` -> `2 * 10 + 0 = 20`

## Transition engine

The transition engine receives:

- previous phase
- previous stability
- drill total out of 100

It returns:

- next phase
- next stability
- transition reason

### Low stability

Score `0-49`:

- next stability: `Low`
- transition reason: `remain`

Score `50-79`:

- next stability: `Medium`
- transition reason: `stability advance`

Score `80-100`:

- next stability: `High`
- transition reason: `stability advance`

### Medium stability

Score `0-44`:

- next stability: `Low`
- transition reason: `stability regress`

Score `45-79`:

- next stability: `Medium`
- transition reason: `remain`

Score `80-100`:

- next stability: `High`
- transition reason: `stability advance`

### High stability

Score `0-49`:

- next stability: `Medium`
- transition reason: `stability regress`

Score `50-84`:

- next stability: `High`
- transition reason: `remain`

Score `85-100`:

- next stability: `High Maintenance`
- transition reason: `stability advance`

### High Maintenance stability

Score `0-59`:

- next stability: `High`
- transition reason: `stability regress`

Score `60-84`:

- next stability: `High Maintenance`
- transition reason: `remain`

Score `85-100`, non-final phase:

- next phase: next phase in sequence
- next stability: `Low`
- transition reason: `phase progress`

Score `85-100`, final phase:

- phase remains `Time Pressure Stability`
- stability remains `High Maintenance`
- transition reason: `remain`

## Transition reason normalization

Only four transition reasons survive normalization:

- `remain`
- `stability advance`
- `stability regress`
- `phase progress`

Anything unknown becomes:

- `remain`

If stored transition reason is absent, `phaseDecision` can infer:

- `advance` -> `phase progress`
- `regress` -> `stability regress`
- anything else -> `remain`

## Observation-to-behavior engine

Raw drill observations become behavior labels through `mapObservationsToBehavior`.

The engine reads observation signal keys and values.

Values are normalized into:

- `weak`
- `partial`
- `clear`

Important rule:

- `partial` does not create a behavior label.
- `weak` creates a weak behavior label.
- `clear` creates a strong behavior label.

If no signal maps:

- `no mapped observation signal detected`

That fallback is filtered out before report behavior aggregation.

## Observation signal extraction

The report engine extracts signals from drill observations like this:

1. If fields ending in `_level` exist, those are used.
2. The `_level` suffix is removed from the key.
3. If no `_level` fields exist, all non-empty observation fields are used.

Example:

- `start_behavior_level: "weak"` becomes `{ key: "start_behavior", value: "weak" }`
- `step_execution_level: "clear"` becomes `{ key: "step_execution", value: "clear" }`

## Full observation behavior mapping

### Clarity behavior rule

Aliases:

- `vocabulary`
- `reason`
- `immediate_apply`
- `immediateapply`

Weak output:

- `clarity breakdown`

Clear output:

- `clearer concept recall`

Absolute version:

- `clear concept recall`

### Method behavior rule

Aliases:

- `method`
- `step`
- `execution`
- `repeatability`

Weak output:

- `inconsistent step execution`

Clear output:

- `more reliable step execution`

Absolute version:

- `reliable step execution`

### Independence behavior rule

Aliases:

- `independence`
- `dependence`
- `support`
- `rescue`

Weak output:

- `early dependence`

Clear output:

- `more independent execution`

Absolute version:

- `independent execution`

### Start behavior rule

Aliases:

- `start`
- `initial`

Weak output:

- `delayed starts`

Clear output:

- `earlier independent starts`

Absolute version:

- `independent starts`

### Difficulty behavior rule

Aliases:

- `boss`
- `discomfort`
- `pressure`
- `first_step`

Weak output:

- `hesitation under pressure`

Clear output:

- `better control under difficulty`

Absolute version:

- `control under difficulty`

### Structure behavior rule

Aliases:

- `structure`
- `completion`
- `integrity`

Weak output:

- `structure breakdown`

Clear output:

- `stronger structure retention`

Absolute version:

- `structure retention`

### Pace behavior rule

Aliases:

- `pace`
- `time`
- `speed`

Weak output:

- `pace loss`

Clear output:

- `more controlled pace`

Absolute version:

- `controlled pace`

## Weak vs strong buckets

After behavior labels are created, report generation divides them into weak and strong buckets.

Weak behavior labels are any labels matching:

- `breakdown`
- `dependence`
- `hesitation`
- `delayed`
- `pace loss`
- `inconsistent`

Current weak labels from the mapping:

- `clarity breakdown`
- `inconsistent step execution`
- `early dependence`
- `delayed starts`
- `hesitation under pressure`
- `structure breakdown`
- `pace loss`

Current strong labels from the mapping:

- `clearer concept recall`
- `more reliable step execution`
- `more independent execution`
- `earlier independent starts`
- `better control under difficulty`
- `stronger structure retention`
- `more controlled pace`

Current strong labels after absolute normalization:

- `clear concept recall`
- `reliable step execution`
- `independent execution`
- `independent starts`
- `control under difficulty`
- `structure retention`
- `controlled pace`

## Top behavior selection

Behavior labels are counted by frequency.

`summarizeBehaviorLabels(labels, limit)`:

- counts occurrences
- sorts descending by count
- takes the first `limit`

Current limits:

- weekly/monthly challenge fields: top `2` weak labels
- weekly response pattern: top `3` absolute behavior labels
- phase-progress behavior clause: top `2` strong late behavior labels

Tie behavior:

- equal counts keep the insertion/order behavior of JavaScript object entries from the counted labels.

## Natural joining

Multiple labels are joined with `naturalJoin`.

Outputs:

- one item: `A`
- two items: `A and B`
- three or more: `A, B, and C`

## Behavior shift engine

`buildBehaviorShiftSummary(earlyBehaviors, lateBehaviors, fallback)` creates comparative behavior movement.

It:

1. Counts early behavior labels.
2. Counts late behavior labels.
3. Finds weak labels that appeared less in late behaviors than early behaviors.
4. Finds strong labels that appeared more in late behaviors than early behaviors, or appeared late but not early.
5. Takes up to `2` reduced weak labels.
6. Takes up to `2` strengthened labels.
7. Joins them naturally.
8. Uses fallback if no shift is found.

Reduced weak output format:

- `less {weak label}`

Strengthened output format:

- `{strong label}`

Possible reduced weak outputs:

- `less clarity breakdown`
- `less inconsistent step execution`
- `less early dependence`
- `less delayed starts`
- `less hesitation under pressure`
- `less structure breakdown`
- `less pace loss`

Possible strengthened outputs:

- `clearer concept recall`
- `more reliable step execution`
- `more independent execution`
- `earlier independent starts`
- `better control under difficulty`
- `stronger structure retention`
- `more controlled pace`

Fallbacks:

- weekly/monthly improvement with stability advance: `showed stronger stability`
- weekly/monthly improvement without stability advance: `improved stability across drills`
- monthly response trend: `showed a more consistent response pattern`

## Topic snapshots

For each report window, `buildTopicSnapshots` groups deterministic sessions by topic.

Each topic snapshot stores:

- first drill state
- last drill state
- drill count
- transition reasons
- latest next action
- per-drill behavior arrays
- all behavior labels

First/last state uses dates:

- earliest date becomes first state
- latest date becomes last state

Topic fallback:

- empty topic becomes `Unknown topic`

## Parent meaning engine

Reports use `buildParentMeaningForContext`.

Inputs:

- first phase
- last phase
- last stability
- transition reasons

Decision order:

1. If latest transition is phase progress and phase changed, use parent entry meaning for the new phase.
2. Else if latest transition is stability regress, use reinforcement message.
3. Else if current state is `Time Pressure Stability (High Maintenance)`, use final maintenance message.
4. Else use parent dashboard copy for current phase/stability.

## Parent entry meanings

`Clarity`:

- `Your child is building the foundation of this topic before independent solving begins.`

`Structured Execution`:

- `Your child has entered independent execution in this topic and is now building consistency without tutor carry.`

`Controlled Discomfort`:

- `Your child has entered the challenge phase in this topic and is learning to stay stable when work becomes difficult.`

`Time Pressure Stability`:

- `Your child has entered timed stability in this topic and is learning to keep structure under urgency.`

## Special parent meanings

Stability regress:

- `This topic needs reinforcement at the current level before moving forward again.`

Final maintenance:

- `Your child is sustaining top-level stability in this topic and we are now maintaining and transferring the skill.`

## Parent dashboard meaning matrix

Used when no phase progress, no stability regress, and no final maintenance override applies.

- `System Movement`: `Linear Equations: entered Controlled Discomfort`
- `What This Means`: `Linear Equations: Your child has entered the challenge phase in this topic and is learning to stay stable when work becomes difficult.`
- `Next Focus`: `Linear Equations: {latestNextAction}`

### Example 3: weekly no improvement

Input:

- topic: `Fractions`
- first state: `Clarity (Medium)`
- last state: `Clarity (Medium)`
- all transition reasons: `remain`

Output:

- `What Improved`: `No stability improvements detected this week`
- `System Movement`: `Fractions: reinforced Clarity`
- `What This Means`: `Fractions: They can follow explanations, but still need reinforcement to apply it independently.`
- `Next Focus`: `Fractions: {latestNextAction}`

### Example 4: monthly mixed topics

Input:

- `Linear Equations`: phase progress into `Controlled Discomfort`
- `Fractions`: remain in `Clarity`

Output:

- `Topics Conditioned`: `Linear Equations, Fractions`
- `What Became Stronger`: `Linear Equations: progressed from Structured Execution to Controlled Discomfort with {strong late behavior labels}`
- `Recurring Challenge`: `Linear Equations: {weak labels}; Fractions: {weak labels}`
- `System Outcome`: `Linear Equations: advanced into Controlled Discomfort; Fractions: held in Clarity`
- `Current Conditioning State`: `Linear Equations - Controlled Discomfort ({stability}); Fractions - Clarity ({stability})`
- `What This Means`: `Linear Equations: Your child has entered the challenge phase in this topic and is learning to stay stable when work becomes difficult.; Fractions: {parent dashboard meaning}`
- `Next Month Focus`: `Linear Equations: Continue training staying stable under difficulty.; Fractions: Continue training recognizing terms, steps, and reasoning.`

## Legacy and fallback behavior

If a report has no structured date range:

- Parent UI marks it as `Legacy format`.

Weekly legacy warning:

- `This report was created before structured ranges were introduced. Some sections may have limited detail.`

Monthly legacy warning:

- `This report was created before structured ranges were introduced. Some sections may have limited detail.`

If a parent-facing field is empty:

- UI displays `Not provided`

Parent weekly empty state:

- `No weekly reports yet. Your tutor will send reports after each week of sessions.`

Parent monthly empty state:

- `No monthly reports yet. Your tutor will send comprehensive monthly summaries.`

Tutor weekly empty state:

- `No weekly reports created yet.`

Tutor monthly empty state:

- `No monthly reports created yet.`
