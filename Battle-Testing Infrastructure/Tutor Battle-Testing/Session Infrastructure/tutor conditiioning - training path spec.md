Tutor Conditioning & Training Pathway to Certification
System-Driven Progression Engine
1. OBJECTIVE

Build a fully systemized tutor development engine where tutor progression is determined by measured alignment, not time served or manual judgment.

The system must condition tutors through doctrine + operations until certification standards are earned.

This mirrors TT-OS student progression:

👉 proof-based advancement
👉 repeated performance
👉 no subjective progression

2. CORE MODES
A. Applicant Mode

Status after signup + documentation completion.

Access:

onboarding docs
agreements
profile setup

No TT-OS access yet.

B. Training Mode

Access granted after documentation completion.

Purpose:
Tutor studies TT-OS modules and undergoes weekly battle tests.

Substates:

B1. Module 1 Training

Transformation Phases

B2. Module 2 Training

Session Infrastructure

C. Sandbox Mode

Unlocked after Module 1 completion.

Tutor gets fake parent/student accounts to learn live system operations.

Used concurrently with Module 2 training.

D. Certified Live Mode

Unlocked after all required modules complete.

Tutor eligible for real paid assignments/ real parents and students.

E. Watchlist Mode

Tutor active but flagged due to declining alignment.

Restrictions configurable.

F. Suspended Mode

Training or live access frozen.

(Modes no more dependent on coo control)

3. MODULE STRUCTURE
Module 1 — Transformation Phases

Deep dives:

Topic Conditioning
Clarity
Structured Execution
Controlled Discomfort
Time Pressure Stability
Module 2 — Session Infrastructure

Deep dives:

Intro Session Structure
Logging System
Session Context & Drill Flow
Drill Library
Handover Verification
Tools Required
4. CERTIFICATION MODEL

Each deep dive has two states:

A. Historical Certification State
In Progress
Completed

Completed when:

👉 3 consecutive battle test scores of 96+

B. Current Health State

Based on latest score:

Locked = 96–100
Watchlist = 90–95
Drift = <90
5. PROGRESSION RULES
Deep Dive Completion Rule

If a tutor scores 96+ three consecutive attempts on a deep dive:

Set:

completed = true
current_streak = 3
completed_at = timestamp
Streak Logic

If score >=96:

current_streak += 1
(max 3 for completion display, but raw streak may continue optionally)

If score <96:

current_streak = 0
Module Completion Rule

Module complete when all deep dives inside module have:

completed = true
Pathway Unlocks
Module 1 Complete

Unlock:

Sandbox Mode
Module 2 access
Module 2 Complete + Module 1 Complete

Unlock:

Certified Live Mode
Eligible for assignments
6. WEEKLY BATTLE TEST ENGINE
Purpose

System selects 2–3 deep dives per live audit session.

TD runs session. No manual topic choosing.

Selection Priority Logic

For each tutor, calculate priority score per deep dive.

Highest Priority Factors:
Not completed
Lowest streak
Recent fail/watchlist
Longest time since last tested
Optional random maintenance on completed dives
Output

Generate weekly assigned session:
e.g
Tutor A:
1. Clarity
2. Logging System
3. Controlled Discomfort

After Each Deep Dive

System updates:

latest_score
health_state
streak
completion if earned

Battle Test Selection Engine (the brain)

Each live check should auto-select 2–3 deep dives using priority scoring.

Priority Order
1. Uncertified + Highest Need

Deep dives not yet completed with lowest streaks.

2. Near Completion Opportunities

Deep dives sitting at streak 2 (chance to complete now).

3. Recent Drift

Any latest score under 96 gets bumped up.

4. Time Since Last Tested

Prevent neglect.

5. Random Maintenance Pull

Occasionally include one completed deep dive to prevent decay.

Example Tutor State
Deep Dive	Certified	Streak	Last Score
Clarity	❌	2	98
Structured Execution	❌	0	88
Controlled Discomfort	✅	-	97
Time Pressure Stability	❌	1	96
Topic Conditioning	✅	-	94
Next Session Auto-Select
Clarity (can complete now)
Structured Execution (needs repair)
Topic Conditioning (maintenance retest)
Session Result Updates

After TD logs answers:

streaks update
certifications trigger
health states update
next session priorities recalculate

Why This Wins

No human admin headache.
No arbitrary schedules.
No forgotten weak spots.

The system always knows the next best pressure points.

CURRENT HEALTH ACTIONS
Locked (96+)

No issue.

Watchlist (90–95)

Flags tutor.

Rules configurable:

mandatory retest next session
visible warning badge
Drift (<90)

Actions configurable:

remove from live assignment pool
retraining mode

CRITICAL FAIL OVERRIDES

Certain answer tags can instantly trigger Drift regardless of score

If triggered:

critical_flag = true
health_state = Drift

POST-CERTIFICATION MAINTENANCE

Certification is not permanent immunity.

Completed deep dives remain completed historically.

But current health still updates from retests.

Example:

Clarity:
completed = true
latest_score = 91
health = Watchlist

TD ACCOUNTABILITY LAYER

Track tutor results grouped by TD.

If multiple tutors under one TD repeatedly drift in same deep dive:

Flag TD.

Example:

3 tutors under TD fail Logging System in 14 days
=> TD operational weakness flag

HOW PROGRESSION SHOULD WORK NOW
Consecutive streaks tracked PER DEEP DIVE, not per session.

That means:

Even though multiple deep dives are tested in one sitting:

Clarity streak updates separately
Structured Execution streak updates separately
Logging streak updates separately

SYSTEM PRINCIPLES

Never progress by time.

Never allow manual completion override.

Never rely on memory.

Everything based on logged proof.

FINAL PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY

We do not hire tutors and hope.

We condition operators until certification becomes inevitable.
